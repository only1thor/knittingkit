# Knitting Stitch Calculator

Calculate how to evenly distribute stitch increases or decreases across a knitting row.

Enter your current and target stitch counts, get a step-by-step pattern with checkboxes to track your progress as you knit.

## Features

- **Even distribution** — uses a Bresenham-style algorithm so extra stitches are spread evenly, not clumped at one end
- **Increases & decreases** — handles normal increases, dense increases (more adds than existing stitches), and k2tog decreases
- **Checklist view** — tick off each step as you go, with a progress bar
- **Built-in verification** — every result is self-checked against your input
- **Dark mode** — toggle or auto-detect from system preference
- **Copy to clipboard** — grab the numbered pattern for notes or sharing
- **Mobile-friendly** — works on any screen size
